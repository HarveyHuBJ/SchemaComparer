# SchemaComparer.GUI

[toc]



## 1. Introduction

**SchemaComparer.GUI.exe** is a windows desktop application. It's designed to help user quickly understand database structure and easily find gaps of 2 databases:

- To explore schemas and tables of a specific database
- To explore the database gaps between 2 different environments

![introduction](./imgs/Introduction.png)

Now, as days went by, we brought more features to enhance it.

## 2. Why we build it?

Sometimes when we engineers are working on a database project, no matter is it  a business repository , or a data warehouse for BI, we always need to quickly understand what residents in the box -- schemas , tables, columns , and how the data is like.

No doubt it's boring to do it by handing-on code, which is easily to fail or fault. So we built this tool to entitle engineers a more convenient way to complete their job.  

Thanks to Danny Xiang, who initiated this work!

### 3.1 Display Information

1. [Both] (F1) Schema and Tables tree
2. [Both] (F2, F3) Columns, Keys, Indexes and Table Info: partition, distribution 
3. [Both] (F6) Difference between same tables of both sides
4. [Right] (F4) Table Summary with rows , size and skew rate (synapse)

![ColumnDiff](./imgs/ColumnDiff.png)



### 3.2 Columns exploring

1. [Both] (F7) By double clicking a column, to find all same name columns in all tables, to compare their type and column properties

![Find-Column](/imgs/Find-Column.png)

It'll be useful when the column types found are not same or even compatible. Like '`CreateDate`', sometimes it's `datetime` type, sometimes it's `int` format as '`yyyyMMdd`'. It'll bring incompatible when linking the two columns together for table joins. By this way, we can easily identify what causes the problem. 



### 3.3 Preview Data

1. [Left] (F14) By right-click on a left table, choose a table and preview it's data of first 1000 rows.

![PreviewData](./imgs/PreviewData.png)

We can easily explore the data in a table by one click, to avoid boring  script code typing.  

### 3.4 Profile table data (TBD)

[Both] (F15) By right-click on a left table, choose a table and profile it's data.

![ProfileData](./imgs/ProfileData.png)

Reference : [Data Profiling with T-SQL â€“ SQLServerCentral](https://www.sqlservercentral.com/articles/data-profiling-with-t-sql)

** This feature is in developing yet.

### 3.5 Export Html Documents

[LEFT] (F8) Export the metadata as HTML documents

![HtmlTables](./imgs/HtmlTables.png)

The output html files are organized by schema names.  Each file contains all tables metadata information, including table columns with properties, such as is_key, name, type, identity, nullable, default value, collation, mask and description, including table indexes, constraints, partitions and distribution(Synapse DW) information. 

This is much more understandable than it's in SSMS or other developer's IDE. 

Even better, we provide a dependencies link if we can define them in a reference file (I'll bring it in another article)

### 3.6 Generate Create-tables script

[LEFT] (F11) Add some tables into watch list and Generate Create-table scripts with their indexes and constraints

![Gen-Create-Table-script](./imgs/Gen-Create-Table-script.png)

(TBD) Table Partitions are in Task queues, not ready now!

(**issues** here:  some abandoned 'Create' words)

### 3.7 Generate Table Delta Script

 [LEFT] (F9) Add some tables into watch list and Generate Compare-table scripts 

![Gen-gap-script](./imgs/Gen-gap-script.png)

This means we can eliminates the gap between tables in 2 environments. 

This feature is much complex when we consider data cannot loss when we change the table structure. I'll left the explanation later.  

## 4. Function underneaths

- When program is starting, it'll load metadata of select databases, specified schemas ( in config) into cache file, then visualize them on WinForms .

- The selected databases are configured in the configuration file. Usually we set 2 ~ 4 database connections of different environments, which will be brought for comparing.
- In case the database are too complex to load fast, we  can add some schemas in '`focusSchemas`' section, which will constrain the schemas to populate.
- The cache files are json format, can be quicker loaded when we're comparing schemas. The cache will be expired in 10 minutes by default.
- The cache files are independent by database name and schema name.
- Metadata Html Documents are generated based on a RAZOR template file, which is at the path as configured.
- Support either **Synapse DW** or **Sql Database**, by selecting an `ISqlCommandText` instance (`SynapseSqlCommandText`, or `SqlDatabaseCommandText`), 
- Support lineage dependency navigation on html doc. The dependency is referenced in '`reference`' configuration section



## 5. Core Queries

For SQL Server or Azure SQL , the following code will collect metadata, including table schema , table name , columns , indexes, primary key, masking, partitions and table summary.
